# I-Volunteer
<h4> *I-Volunteer is an education volunteering platform</h4> 
  
  <p> <font style="italic"> In India we have lot of problems in public education in rural areas such as lack of schools and resources. Currently there are lot of government programmes and local communities for helping them . But we can only acknowledge problems and lack of availability through government and associate firms . So that we decided to create a platform for sharing volunteer emergency to take classes for students in rural areas . The main objective of this platform is a normal person can share their educational problem and any person can request for volunteering too</font></p> 
  
*This project was made in a Hackathon. so that now its opensource project. therefor you can extend and improve this source code for your use
